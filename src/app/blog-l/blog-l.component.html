                                JITHU CS was inspired to pray against an assassination attempt on Donald J Trump
                                while praying on Friday morning, 16 May 2025, and immediately felt like checking the
                                news on the YouTube Channel. As JITHU CS was watching the news on 8647, the time was 10:57
                                AM IST. The Holy Spirit inspired JITHU CS to connect with his mom to handle the prayer
                                request,
                                and as JITHU CS reported the matter, his mom told him that she used to pray for President
                                Donald J
                                Trump. As she told him this, the time was 11:07 AM IST, and the other 2 occurrences of
                                the number 7 in the YouTube news video are ignored, because what is relevant is giving
                                a <b> SNIPER PROPHECY</b> (Sharp Shooter of the enemy) with a word of prayer.
